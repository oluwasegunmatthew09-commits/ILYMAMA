    <h1>Hey Mama 💖</h1>

    <p>
      I just want to take a moment to tell you how much you truly mean to me.
      Words will never be enough, but I’ll try my best 💕.
    </p>

    <p>
      I thank God every single day for bringing you into my life 🙏.
      Seeing you, knowing you, loving you — it has been one of the greatest
      blessings of my life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for taking care of me, for standing by me,
      for your patience, your kindness, and your sweet love 🥰.
      You’ve shown me what genuine love feels like, and I don’t take that for granted.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your smile brightens my darkest days 🌸,
      your love gives me strength,
      and your presence brings peace to my heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      I appreciate everything you do for me —
      the big things, the small things, and even the things you don’t realize 💞.
    </p>

    <p class="ending">
      I love you, Aminatta ❤️
